I'm Darryl Nicerio, a web developer that (as of now) specializes in the front-end department. This website was made to showcase all of what I have done, can do and plan to do.\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              I got into development because of my love for computers, the internet and learning new technologies. That desire to always learn has naturally led me to this path.\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              As a web developer, it's only natural for me to have experience in languages such as HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript. I also have experience developing in some front-end frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap, React.js and GatsbyJS.\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              If you need someone with these skillset and like my work, please feel free to head over to the Contact section so we can get in touch. I would love to hear from you.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/about-primary-ba5b9300515bc0f1e44fbad29dca64b0.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
